## About Me 😇

Curious by nature and driven by data, I’m a passionate Data Analyst with 3+ years of experience turning raw numbers into meaningful business stories.

I specialize in Python, Excel, SQL (MySQL), and Power BI — tools I’ve used to clean messy datasets, build high-impact dashboards, and automate reports that save hours of manual effort. My work often uncovers hidden patterns, enabling smarter decisions in domains like sales, supply chain, hospitality, and marketing.

Beyond the technicals, I take pride in bridging the gap between data and people — communicating insights in a way that actually moves teams forward. Whether it's collaborating cross-functionally or presenting to non-technical stakeholders, clarity is always at the core of what I do.

Deeply interested in AI and Machine Learning, I’m continuously learning how to bring innovative thinking to real-world data challenges.

## Goal 🌏

I’m focused on delivering clean, insightful, and automation-ready analytics using Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI. My goal is to contribute to projects that solve real business problems, explore AI/ML applications meaningfully, and keep evolving with the future of data.
